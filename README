I am not the original author. I found this plugin and forked it because I wanted it to control the ThinkLight on my ThinkPads, which requires you to write "on" or "off", not "1" or "0", to /proc/acpi/ibm/light. I sent a patch to the original author but never received a response.

Below is the original README text.
==========

Led-notification, a Pidgin plugin
----------------

Led-notification can control leds found on some laptops, or anything else that is controlled by writing '1' or '0' to a file.
